# CAPITALS OF THE WORLD QUIZ

The Capitals of the world quiz is a quiz trivia site for anyone who is interested in testing their knowledge on world capitals or for anyone who just wants to study up. The user can choose by continent which countries they want to be tested on to improve any knoweledge gaps they may have.

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")

## UX

The site has an outer space style design. There are two reasons for this choice.
The first is that it is to give the user the feeling that they are in space away from Earth and are trying to remember the capitals.
The second reason is that the high contrast of the dark space and the bright question card is dynamic and visually interesting to look at without being too ditracting.

### Colour Scheme


- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.




### Typography

To fit with the outer space theme I chose to use the Exo-2 font as it has a Sci-fi look. 

Example:

- [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2?query=exo) was used for the primary headers and titles.

## Wireframes

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.

Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
